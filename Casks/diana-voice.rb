  caveats <<~EOS
    Diana Voice needs two macOS permissions on first launch:

      1. Microphone — for push-to-talk speech recognition
         (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone)
      2. Accessibility — for the global push-to-talk hotkey
         (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility)

    Grant both when prompted, or enable them manually in System Settings.
